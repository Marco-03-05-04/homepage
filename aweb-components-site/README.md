## ðŸš€ Quick start

### Start developing

   ```sh
   npm install
   npm run start
   ```

   #### Explanation
   The `start` npm task launches concurrently three other npm tasks:
   1. `watch`: Watches all `.svelte` files in the `src` directory and rebuilds a single component when it changes.
   2. `watch-pages`: Watches all `.html` page templates in the `src/pages` directory and rebuilds a single page when it changes.
   3. `serve`: serve all the content in the `/public` directory on `0.0.0.0:8080`. Cache should be disabled by default.

### Create a new component

   To implement a new component you need to create a `.svelte` file. Don't forget to include the necessary tag at line 1 of the file:

   ```html
   <svelte:options tag="svelte-component" />
   ```

### Components style

All site style is written with [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/). The only exception is the small CSS snippet to style the `html` and `body` page elements, which is injected in each page template (see below).

Due to the WebComponents CSS isolation, all common styles must be included in each web component. Usually adding

```scss
  @import "./styles/main";
```

at the top of the component style tag does the trick. `main.scss` conveniently includes all common styles.

Each component has his own style inside, not accessible from the outside.


### Page templates

In order to reduce duplicated code to a minimum, the common code shared by them is injected on build time with the help of the [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template engine.

Each site page should contain only the page metadata, the WebComponents imports, and the bare minimum page code (most of it should be in a Svelte component anyway).

The common page parts are in the `/build-page.js` file.

## ðŸ’« Deploy

### Deploy to S3 + Cloudfront

#### Using the CI

Push your changes to the `master` to deploy to [development website](https://www.topsolution.dev)
Push a git tag to deploy to [production website](https://www.topsolution.it)
